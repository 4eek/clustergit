--- Get Status ---
Ever wanted to get the status of repos in multiple sub directories? Yeah, me too. So I knocked this up.

-- Installation --
Copy the file to /usr/bin

%> cp show_status /usr/bin (or /usr/sbin)

Give it execute permissions

%> chmod +x /usr/bin/show_status

-- Usage --
show_status [directory]

Running this will look in each subdirectory of your current directory for a '.git' file. If it finds one, it'll run 'git status' and ouput to the screen

-- example --
%> show_status
	Runs on the current dir
%> show_status /home/somewhere/where/you/git
	Runs on the specified directory
